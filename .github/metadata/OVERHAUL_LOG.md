# DevMatch Premium Overhaul: Technical Log

## Phase 1: Architectural UI Foundation
- **Global Design Tokens**: Standardized `glass-premium` utility in `globals.css` with multi-layered specular highlights and backdrop-blur-2xl.
- **Universal Tactility**: Implemented `active:scale-95` and `transition-all` across all interactive elements (Button, Link, Navbar) to ensure a high-end, reactive UI feel.
- **Color Palette Refinement**: Transitioned to curated HSL/OKLCH color tokens for consistent dark-mode depth.

## Phase 2: Luxury Hero Shimmer

- **Onboarding Architecture**: Developed a 4-step state machine for user data ingestion:
    - **Basics**: Identity & GitHub verification.
    - **Role Selection**: High-end interactive role cards with shadow-glow active states.
    - **Tech Stack**: Dynamic badge system for real-time skill mapping.
    - **Work Style**: Comprehensive team-dynamic preferences.
- **Flow Logic**: Integrated an `onComplete` callback mechanism to transition from data ingestion to match results without a page refresh.
